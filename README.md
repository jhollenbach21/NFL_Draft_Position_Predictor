# NFL Draft Position Predictor
This was one of the first projects I ever made in Python, and really helped me see what can be done in data science. In this project I test multiple different machine learning models to predict what round a player will be drafted based on their NFL Combine data. I use cross validation, and accuracy scores. Through this testing I was able to find that the decision tree model seperated for player position was most accurate. It would be interesting to continue to try to improve this model as more NFL Combine data is collected each year. Most of the machine learning is done using the library sci-kit learn, other crucial libraries are Pandas and Matplotlib.
